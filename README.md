## Description

Cosmic Drift is a quiet, night journey, where a blob travels through an endless night sky.

The user slowly drifts across a universe, where stars shimmer. Constellations and collectibles are hidden throughout the map and can be found by the user through moving around. These hidden shapes can only be revealed through the user lingering for a long period of time.

The user can press "A" to move backward, "D" to move foward, "W" to move upward, and "S" to move downward. Pressing space creates shooting stars that come from the blob.

The goal is to explore the cosmos while discovering hidden constellations and collectibles!
